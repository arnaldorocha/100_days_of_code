# 100 Days of Code - My Python Journey üöÄüêç

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code - Beginner Python Projects** repository!  
Here, I'll document my 100-day journey learning Python by following the _"100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"_ course on Udemy.  
During this time, I'll build 100 unique projects‚Äîone per day‚Äîthat range from small scripts to full-fledged applications.  
Each project represents an important step in my evolution as a developer.
