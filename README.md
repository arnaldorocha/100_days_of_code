# Beginner Python Projects 🚀🐍

Welcome to my **Beginner Python Projects** repository! This is a collection of projects that mark the start of my journey into Python programming. Here, I document my growth and the skills I’m learning along the way. As I progress, I continue to take on more challenging projects, and this repository will reflect my evolution in Python and programming as a whole.

## 📂 Current Projects
At the moment, I'm diving into some foundational topics and working on:

### 1. **Variables**    
I'm getting comfortable with variables—assigning values, storing data, and understanding the importance of naming conventions.  
- **Skills Learned**: Assigning values, variable naming conventions, and manipulating data.

---

### 2. **Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings**  
I’m working on understanding Python’s core data types and string manipulation. These are crucial skills to ensure I can handle and process data effectively in Python.  
- **Skills Learned**: Handling integers, floats, booleans, and strings; slicing and formatting strings; converting between data types.

---

### 3. **Control Flow and Logical Operators**  
I’m learning how to control the flow of programs with conditions and loops, gaining hands-on experience with logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.  
- **Skills Learned**: Writing `if-else` statements, using loops (`for`, `while`), and building logic with operators.

### 4. **Randomisation and Python Lists**  
Exploring how to add randomness to programs and work with Python lists to store and manage collections of data.  
- **Skills Learned**:  
  - Using the `random` module to generate random numbers or selections.  
  - Creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over lists.  
  - Combining lists and randomness for dynamic program behavior.

## 🎯 My Goal with This Repository
My main goal with this repository is to track my progress and share my journey as I learn Python. Each project represents a step forward in my understanding of the language, and I’m eager to build a solid foundation that will help me grow into an advanced Python developer. As I continue learning, I'll be adding more projects and pushing myself to explore more complex topics.
